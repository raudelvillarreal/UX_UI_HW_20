        <h1 class="cardTitle">Booking Buddy</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">People are busy. They are also on a budget. 
            Spending precious hours scouring the various travel booking applications trying to find the best deals is tedious and frustrating. 
            What if the deals came to you? What if all you had to do was ask your buddy? 
        </p>
    </div>
      <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Project Overview</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">The first design challenge of my UX/UI Bootcamp was to develop a mobile app to help travelers book their trips. 
            I, myself, was not an extensive traveler, so I knew I would have to familiarize myself with the subject a bit more. 
            It became apparent early on that I was going to have to rely extensively on user research to help me grasp the problem. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Research Plan and Methodology </h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">Before any research was enacted, a research plan was drawn up. I wanted to find out the following:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Qualitative Data</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">Interviews were conducted with 5 volunteers. Each was gracious enough to talk with me over Zoom. 
            The interviews were recorded and the data was anonymized. 
            From the interviews, qualitative statements began to give insight as to what users disliked about booking travel online, and the themes of frustration emerged over the time consuming nature of securing a good travel deal. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Insights and Affinity Map</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">Guiding insights were pulled from the interviews. After the insights were collected they were then categorized into an affinity map using Miro. 
            The affinity map gave me categorical ideas that would help me develop my problem statement, user persona, and jumpstart the ideation process. This is where certain themes began to emerge. 
            The interviewees loved to travel, but found researching flight and hotel deals to be time consuming and frustrating. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Empathy Map</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">An empathy map was drawn up in Miro to begin to express what the user says, thinks, feels and does. 
            Pain points were expressed as well, along with their primary travel goals.  
            This helped me hone in on the motivations driving my potential user as well as present the frustrations she was experiencing. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">User Persona</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">At long last a user persona emerges. Using Miro again, this persona was fleshed out using bits of qualitative data from the user interviews. 
            This user persona offered up guidance in developing the problem statement and eventual prototype. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Problem Statement</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">First utilizing “user insight” statements and “how might we” statements, 
            the problem statement was constructed to include the initial issues that were plaguing the users as well as the prompting question for the developer: How might be address this problem?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Prioritizing Features</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">How best to solve the problem? Brainstorming began by developing ideas based around what customers were seeking. With the help of a classmate, the ideas were shuffled into similar categories and voted on using dots. 
            The features that received the most dots were placed on a prioritization matrix to determine which features needed to be present in the initial prototype. </p>
        <p class= "pStyle">To map out exactly what the app would be delivering to customers, a value proposition chart was filled in. The highlighted feature of the app would be a tagging/pinning function of specific flights and hotels after a search. Any accommodations the user was interested in could be pinned for monitoring. The app would then track over time if the flight prices changed. The app would notify the user of this giving them quality price information, thereby giving them the control over the price they wanted to pay and would lead to a sale. 
            This also eliminates the need for the user to spend time searching for the deals themselves. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Telling the Story</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">To convey to potential stakeholders what a particular user was going through when dealing with travel booking sites and to showcase how my app planned to alleviate that stress, 
            three methods were used: user scenario, user journey, and a storyboard. 
        </p>
        <p class= "pStyle">The user scenario and user journey offer two flavors of roughly the same concept. 
            It highlights the sequential events that the user is going through when using the app. 
            It highlights how the app offers up the solution the user has been searching for, therefore demonstrating the value the app holds. 
        </p>
        <p class= "pStyle">I felt particularly excited to offer up a storyboard to help illustrate the scenario. 
            I was able to utilize my skills as an artist and storyteller to convey more emotion when depicting the user’s journey. 
            The storyboard is able to clearly convey the initial frustration the user is experiencing trying to complete her task followed by the discovery of the app which at this point has been given the name, Booking Buddy. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">Competitor Analysis</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">At the recommendation of my instructor, I was told I should do a competitor analysis on the apps, 
            Skyscanner and Hopper, which are two booking apps that have similar functions to the one I was proposing. Each helps the traveler track prices over time and alerts the user to any changes in price. 
            Also, this analysis aided in producing inspiration when it came to applying some of the layout in regards to my app. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">User Flow and Sketch Prototype</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">The user flow was constructed to map out the simple onboarding process. 
            Then, the first prototype wireframes were sketched out by hand. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
       <h1 class="cardTitle">Low Fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">After initial sketching was complete, 
            Figma was used to construct the first low fidelity wireframes. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">User Testing and Findings</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">The first user tests were conducted with classmates and friends who were willing to meet with me over Zoom.  
            A total of 4 user tests were conducted. The app was tested using InVision prototyping and two user scenarios were tested: (1) onboarding and (2) searching and tagging flights. 
            Some of the initial findings were as follows:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="cardTitle">High Fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">Going back into Figma, and taking into account the user testing findings, the high fidelity prototype was created. 
            The light blue color scheme was added as well as a placeholder logo and onboarding screens so the user has an idea of how the app works.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
       <h1 class="cardTitle">Final Thoughts and Moving Forward</h1>
        <p class= "pStyle">This being my first UX design challenge, I didn’t know what to expect. 
            I certainly didn’t know how much work was going to be involved which both excited and intimidated me. 
            When I finally reached the end, I couldn’t believe how much work I had done. Being a part of this bootcamp was an extraordinary experience. 
            It is especially notable, because my classmates and I did this during a pandemic. All things considered, I think the app is good for being a first attempt. 
        </p>

        <p class= "pStyle">I feel the premise of offering the user an opportunity to tag and watch the flights they want is being expressed clearly and holds a lot of promise for future iterations. 
            I think the interface is simple enough as to not overwhelm first time users. 
            Creating utility is key, and I think the current app is expressing that. More iterations will need to be made in order for an app like this to showcase viability.
